# Day-Planner-Homework
The purpose of the day planner is to help create increments of time on a digital "planner" to better set aside time for certian activities and tasks. The planner allows you to create different tasks and times for other activites and put them on the time slots provided. When it is time to complete a task or activity the planner will show a pop up alerting the user of this activity. The current time block will be highligted.
